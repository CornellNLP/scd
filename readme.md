### Data

[First Release (the data used in our paper)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13-cykGDksRu0VQCOlMEcN0ScC-X7v3jo/view?usp=sharing): 

* 437 conversations and their Summaries of Conversation Dynamics (SCDs) generated by our GPT procedural prompt. 
* 50 of the conversations in the test set also have corresponding human-written SCDs. 
* The same data can also be accessed via the ConvoKit library, which contains additional conversation meta-data and various useful functionalities.

We are **expanding** our dataset. Future releases will include more human-written SCDs and conversation-level dynamics labels to facilitate future research and broader applications. Please stay tuned.
