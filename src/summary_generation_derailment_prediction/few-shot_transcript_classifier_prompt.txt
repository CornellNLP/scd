Example 1
[Transcript]:
SPEAKER1: If my business closes down because I cannot afford the overhead of now paying double to triple all of my entry level employee salaries, I now do not have a job and am in considerable debt. On top of that, myself and all of my employees are now unemployed.

Let's get this straight - the businesses that will be hurt are not the walmarts and other massive conglomerates. They are the local businesses with 3-15 employees, who are making just enough of a living and can afford to do what they do. They aren't taking in millions in profit.

SPEAKER2: But then the government is paying for you to be in business. If your employees don't make enough to money to feed them selves and have a place to live, the gov steps up with SNAP and section 8. Why should I have to pay more taxes so that you can operate this business with out paying the expense ? 

SPEAKER3: If they're unemployed, wouldn't the government be paying them (and taxing you) even more? How is shutting down the business going to cut your tax bill?

SPEAKER2: But that's assuming that there would just be no Business of people were paid a living wage. The market would adjust  

SPEAKER4: The market always adjusts...  and widespread price controls on labor (or anything else) cause shortages and hit the poor the hardest.  

SPEAKER5: It's so funny that everyone thinks that minimum wage is the solution and not the reason that a lot of people in the US are unemployed in the first place. 

SPEAKER3: Generally speaking, the people advocating for higher minimum wage don't believe it would help the unemployed, they're trying to help the working poor.

I disagree with their position too, but there's no need to intentionally misrepresent it.

SPEAKER5: &gt; they're trying to help the working poor.

Yes, and they're going to make the poor more poor in the process due to their lack of economic literacy.

&gt; I disagree with their position too, but there's no need to intentionally misrepresent it.

There's no misrepresentation of the argument here. 


SPEAKER3: &gt;There's no misrepresentation of the argument here. 

Yes, there is. Let's take a look at your original comment:

&gt;It's so funny that everyone thinks that minimum wage is the solution

This is true, they do believe that minimum wage is the solution to the problem of some people with full time jobs not making enough money to maintain a certain standard of living.

However, the rest of your comment doesn't talk about that problem, it refers instead to the issue of high unemployment:

&gt;and not the reason that a lot of people in the US are unemployed in the first place. 

This is a different problem than the one they're trying to solve.

Your comment is like saying:

&gt;It's so funny that everyone thinks chemotherapy is the solution and not the reason that the the cancer patient's hair fell out in the first place.

Minimum wage isn't about decreasing unemployment, and chemotherapy isn't about curing baldness. It's a negative side effect that needs to be considered in the overall discussion, but the fact that it has negative side effects at all doesn't make it an inherently stupid idea.

SPEAKER5: &gt; However, the rest of your comment doesn't talk about that problem, it refers instead to the issue of high unemployment:

Well if you're unemployed, you're not making enough money and hence not making a "liveable" wage.

&gt; Minimum wage isn't about decreasing unemployment,

I never made it out to be about decreasing unemployment. And your analogy is so flawed.... I dont know what to say.

Example 2
SPEAKER1: Economic here. Danish, so please excuse my lack of terms in English and if any grammatical errors might occur. 

This is a political decision that is looked at from an economical perspective that primarily takes position in macro economics. You are so naive to say that your focus ain't laying on the financial situation of businesses, only the motivation and happiness of the workers. Well that just makes you an asshole to be short and clear. That isn't how the system works and that is never going to be how the system works. 

1st. It will be bad for the economy as a whole. 

Yes, you may raise the salary of the lowest income group. This will indeed raise the equivalent disposable income, which is good. However most smaller businesses can't afford having employees on this wage level, thereby firing them. This will decrease the employment rate, and will increase the amount of people on social welfare. This will in terms worsen the economic situation of the country. I will explain various theories like inflationary crowding in the second section. However this will affect the following negatively: production, employment rates, competitiveness, inflation, prices, wage, export and import. This is extremely shortened as I do not want to get into details. 

2nd. This will affect a smaller portion of the country negatively. A portion that we want to see positively changed. 

This will not affect major companies that can afford to hire on this salary level. This will affect startups and smaller companies that need to hire on an income scale that can meet their needs. This is a portion that is always talked of positively. The US live in a welfare state (Residual welfare state) that is dominated by a liberalistic (Neoclassical) thoughts. This means that the economy is market controlled with little to no state intervention. The US likes smaller startups as they are a source of employment. By not giving them an opportunity to hire on the desired salary level, you remove the job position as a whole. This will mean that the company cannot afford to expand. Which in terms can mean that the company needs to close. On a macro level this can be catastrophic; Though inflationary crowding a decrease in expand-ability will mean a decrease in production, this will mean the employment will decrease, the unemployment will rise (These are two different things in Danish), the salaries will be decreased to meet levels where employment can be met, the prices will be lowered.  

When you look at all this, it will become a major disadvantage for the employers of lower income employees and an disadvantage for lower income employees as the unemployment will rise. I really hope this makes sense. 

3rd. Would you rather be in a low income job or be unemployed? 

What would you be most happy about? Having a job that can provide you will an income (Yes, it might be small however it's still larger than the basic social income from the state). Or would you be unemployed and living on social income? I guess the first. By raising the minimum wage, as mentioned earlier, you make it less desirable to have an employee employed. 

&gt;but overall it'd have a positive impact on business for a few reasons. --more motivated employees. --happier employees ect

Well this is both true and false. There are something called the "employee types". These are different perspectives of the employees in a company. These types reflect the preferences of the employee. How he's motivated and what makes the person happy. It's far from every employee type that gets motivated by income. Many are motivated by the social network and the work itself. Yes, it might improve some employee types that is correct. However it's far from everyone. 

This was written kinda in a hurry, however I hope you get my drift. The negatives will far outshine the positives. Even on a short run model, the fact that employment will increase as the wage increases will quickly leave a mark and decrease the actual economic gap that should have been made as you try to increase the economic capital of the country. 

Be pleased to comment if you have questions. 

Best regards,  
Tarron


SPEAKER2: Amen. The financial and economic literacy of the vast majority of leftist voters if scary. 

SPEAKER1: Well I won't really formulate it like that. However I can't really see how this can have a positive effect in your welfare model. This would work perfectly if you have a socialistic welfare model, or had the same active labor force politics (Like the flexicurity model) like many of the more socialistic nations do. But in the current state I think that they should focus more on changing models (If that is what they want) instead of increasing the lowest income group.

This is a perfectly valid opinion regarding economics, however I simply want to be sure that they understand the complexity of macro economics. And don't look at it with a narrow and naive perspective.

SPEAKER2: &gt; This would work perfectly if you have a socialistic welfare model

As if this hasn't been a failed experiment several times over...

SPEAKER1: In the US maybe, however it has been successfully integrated in the Universal welfare model. This is a model that currently resides in some of the best ranked countries in the world regarding social economical status, economic equality, education and research such as Finnland and Scandinavia, where I currently live and work.

I think it would take a lot of dedication and require Utopia like responsiveness from the general population to work. However it is possible to integrate such a model into the US economic model.

SPEAKER2: &gt; Finnland and Scandinavia,

You mean the places where the vast majority of educated workers leave in droves because their economic worth is not realized? 

SPEAKER1: This isn't really true, both statements. The vast majority still finds work in their respective country. Some seeks outwards to other nations in hope of work, however still remains under a company, and some. Yes, finds another nation to work in for economical gains. However the salaries of these countries far exceeds many of the surrounding nations. I am not sure that I would have the same income in the US as I would here. Yes, I might just have a higher equivalent disposable income, however taking medical care, education for my children and insurance into play I won't really count on it. I am perfectly fine paying upwards to 47% of my income in taxes as long as I know the economic worth of it on a macro scale. We don't have forced homeless people in Denmark where I come from. We have a really high social income that you can live on. This is something that I, personally, am willing to pay almost half my salary to get. Not for me, but for the best of my peers. 

SPEAKER2: &gt; The vast majority still finds work in their respective country.

Why pick that arbitrary number? 

http://www.thelocal.se/20160107/more-swedes-than-ever-are-moving-abroad

Considering that the number of swedish emigrants grows year after year.... I'd hardly count the so called "social utopia" a success. 

&gt; Yes, I might just have a higher equivalent disposable income, however taking medical care, education for my children and insurance into play I won't really count on it.

Then you are just factually wrong. http://skift.com/2013/05/15/u-s-has-the-highest-disposable-income-as-uk-slips-down-the-list/

Example 3
[Transcript]:
SPEAKER1: They is an accepted and common gender neutral singular pronoun, although we are most familiar with it in written language, not spoken language. That being said, I understand the frustration to an extent. I know a person who is very similar: their gender presentation is, if not conventionally feminine, at least readably female but they prefer they/them pronouns and it can be difficult and confusing for your mind to see "she" and then need to remember to actually say they at first. 

But here are a few reasons I don't think it's an "unreasonable" request:

1. It's not actually *that* difficult, once you accept it. It might be a challenge at first, but you will be surprised how quickly it becomes normal to see that person and think "they" once you've established that pattern. You are, of course, always allowed to just use their name. Someone preferring the pronoun they doesn't mean you can't use their name instead.
2. For some people, "they" is a political statement, one that articulates a resistance to the ways in which gender assignation shapes our lives and horizon of possibilities. While I don't necessarily agree that this is the "best" tactic for realizing this political critique, the denaturalization of gender is not a goal I disagree with.
3. For some people, "they" or other non-binary gender identities is a first step in coming to terms with binary trans identities. Of course, not all non-binary people will transition, but asking for gender neutral pronouns is a common way for people who are discomforted or even dysphoric about being gendered a particular way to get comfortable with the idea that they might be (binary) trans without making a full commitment. The person I mentioned above? Their partner also preferred they/them pronouns when I first met him, but he is now in the process of medical and legal transition and uses he/him. They/them allowed him to explore his gender identity and accept that he is a transman because it provided time and space for him to begin thinking of himself outside of his assigned female identity. 

In short, my view is basically: unless you hold the position that there are two "real" genders that always and without fail align perfectly with biological sex, there is not real reason not to recognize and incorporate non-binary pronouns into your vocabulary. The benefits outweigh the burden, and once you become accustomed to it, it's not actually that difficult. That being said, if you are acting in good faith and mistakenly slip up once or twice and the person in question is an unforgiving jerk about it, they are an *unreasonable* person. But that doesn't mean the use of gender neutral pronouns is unreasonable.

SPEAKER2: Thank you for your thorough response! 
First, the student reacted angrily and seemed accusing and argumentative right off the bat, which I think may have lead me to think of it as unreasonable immediately.
I agree that it is fine as a singular neutral pronoun. However, the student made it clear that they prefer this pronoun in the plural sense. 
I'm looking for a way to rationalize this plurality, and your mention of a "transition state" sort of helped with that.
&amp;#8710;

SPEAKER3: I honestly think that you're overthinking it.

It's like if you said to your coworker "Hey, Becky, how's it going?" and she said "Actually, my name isn't Becky- it's Vanessa. I'm doing great, how are you?" And from then on you called her Vanessa. That's it. Full stop. I think common decency is if someone doesn't want to be called something, don't call them that. It isn't up to you weigh the reasonableness of it.

SPEAKER4: Okay I want to be called Your Highness the Slave Master. It's not up to you to weigh the reasonableness of it. Common decency right?

SPEAKER3: I suppose. I think it would make me feel uncomfortable, though, so I'd either avoid using your name or talking you in general. It's not a big deal.

Also, this is such a lazy argument. Becky and Vanessa, she and they, are not in the same category as Your Highness the Slave Master. It sounds as though you really want to have a problem with what I've said.

SPEAKER4: It's making you feel uncomfortable because you are weighing the reasonableness of it, and because you find it unreasonable you are avoiding respecting my personal identity and even communicating with me?

What if I'm your student and that's the only name I identify by? Doesn't feel good to be forced to capitulate, does it?

The very thing you ask others not to do is the thing you do. This is the hypocrisy that people don't like about PC culture and the political left. The madness needs to stop, it's 2 genders. Full stop. 

SPEAKER3: What you are talking about is unrealistic, and you are putting a lot of energy into a scenario that is so unrealistic. I am sorry you think someone insisting upon a certain pronoun is madness, but however you feel about it, Your Highness the Slave Master is not in the same category as Becky or Vanessa. You are trying to take my comparison of given names and pronouns farther than it needs to go, and inventing hypocrisy where there is none. Also, if it makes someone more comfortable to be called "they" instead of he or she, why not? Why insist upon a lack of empathy?

SPEAKER4: We aren't talking about changing standard names. We are talking about a child, a little girl who is insisting that an adult refer to her by a grammatically incorrect pronoun because she "thinks" or "feels" that she is another gender. It's bogus. It's likely child abuse. No normal child would have any clue about any of this if it weren't for their parents pushing it on them. She's probably just going through a tomboy phase. Either way, it doesn't matter because she's a girl and she needs parents to help her understand that. 

We live in a world where Reals &gt; Feels. Sorry you don't like that. The truth is important, a boy is a boy, a girl is a girl, a tree is a tree, murder is murder. No more fantasy land crap unless you want it to bite you back in the ass because that's what will happen in a world that fails to recognize truth. 

SPEAKER5: &gt; No normal child would have any clue about any of this if it weren't for their parents pushing it on them

Trans people can come from transphobic families just as much as from more accepting ones. Parental attitudes hardly define a child's gender.


&gt; a grammatically incorrect pronoun

They can be used in the singular form ('someone has left their coat on the floor') as well as in the plural. The kid in question is using they in a plural form to describe themselves, sure, but that doesn't make all non-binary people using singular they/them pronouns grammatically incorrect. And if it's used incorrectly to refer to one person, so what? I think the meaning's pretty clear, and grammar and language has always been evolving over time. But can we not have some empathy for the kid? I'd rather respect their personal identity and ensure that they're comfortable than stick rigidly to my grammar rulebook. They're just one kid. Have some respect for how they feel and give them a break for a second.


&gt; a tomboy phase


A previous commenter suggested that they might be  experimenting with they/them pronouns to become more comfortable with identifying as a trans boy, which is fairly common amongst trans people. If so, surely that would mean using they/them pronouns is important for them to transition to this either male or female gender boundary you so strongly defend. If, through using more neutral they/them pronouns, this kid discovers they are trans and choose to transition, that will affect them for the rest of their life. It's not something that 'doesn't matter'. It's about respecting and empathising with their position whether or not you agree with it.

SPEAKER4: How about no. It's has nothing to do what what I "agree" with. The only thing I agree with is the truth and that reals mean more than feels.

It's feels that makes the person think they are transgender.

It's reals that says "No, you're not. You are what you were born as." That is the adults job and responsibility to tell the child that. If you don't, you're a bad parent that needs to be investigated by CPS.

So you don't have a problem with me or what I agree with you have a problem with the truth. Deal with it on your own terms.

Example 4
SPEAKER1: I agree with you. But I would like to point out that “they” can apply to a single person:

*The patient should be told at the outset how much they will be required to pay.*

*They left their umbrella here*

Not the view you were looking to change, and I don’t know if that will change the way you look at the rest of the issue.

SPEAKER2: Thanks for your reply! I think that really would make it easier to use if "they" hadn't specified that "they" feel like "they" are plural. That helps, but I guess I am sort of looking for an explanation as to why this is a reasonable expectation for the student ("students"? lol idek) to hold others to.

SPEAKER1: It isn’t reasonable. I think that we should call people “he” or “she” based on their sex. It eliminates a lot of confusion.

Plus, what prompts somebody to identify as a girl or boy based on gender? Their interests? The kind of clothes they like? In a society where “gender rolls” are melding together I believe that gender is a pretty irrelevant.

SPEAKER2: Thank you for bringing that to light. I've never really thought of that. I agree that gender roles play a large part of that.

SPEAKER1: I would understand identifying as a certain gender more if we still had clear cut gender rolls.

If a “man” was still supposed to be rugged, hard working, emotionless, and (insert stereotypical roll here).

And a “woman” was supposed to be pretty, a caregiver, a cook, a cleaner or whatever.

Then yeah, take your choice. Now, those are seen as sexist and outdated roles. So how does one identify as a man or woman now? “I like to wear skirts and makeup, I’m a girl” or “I like trucks and sports, I’m a boy”.

I just don’t understand the whole culture and see the whole pronoun thing as a non-issue. 

SPEAKER3: &gt; If a “man” was still supposed to be rugged, hard working, emotionless, and (insert stereotypical roll here).

&gt; And a “woman” was supposed to be pretty, a caregiver, a cook, a cleaner or whatever.

There are plenty of masculine trans women, and feminine trans men.  It has nothing to do with gender roles.

SPEAKER1: Then what does it involve? What makes a person “feel” like a man or woman?

SPEAKER3: Gender identity is a biological trait, much like sexual orientation.  It's unfortunately a misnomer, and has more to do with biological sex than gender.  We have the "gender" terminology for mostly historical reasons, and I hope it will eventually change to something like "psychological / neurological sex", because the current terminology is confusing.

Basically, it's what sex your brain is wired to expect for you. It impacts your mental body map (which can cause physical dysphoria if your actual body doesn't match.. this is like phantom limb syndrome, if you're familiar), and how you subconsciously expect others to interact with you (which can cause social dysphoria if others don't recognize you as that sex).

It's actually very similar to sexual orientation, and can be thought of in much the same way.  

As in:

Gay men and straight women are sexually and/or romantically compatible with men and not women, while lesbians and straight men are sexually and/or romantically compatible with women and not men.

Similarly, cis and trans men (those with male gender identities) are exclusively compatible with occupying a male body and social role, while cis and trans women (those with female gender identities) are exclusively compatible with occupying a female body and social role.

SPEAKER1: Okay, this is the best answer I’ve received to date. The “my mind doesn’t fit my body” thing is incredibly abstract to me. However the social role part is what I’ve been getting at in other comments. As our society moves away from male/female social roles (which is a long ways away until they’re gone, if ever) does this mean that the social roll part doesn’t matter as much?

Say we reach a point where male/female rolls are unified and no longer exist as separate ideas. Would people still be able to grasp that they’re in the “wrong” body? The social role part seems to be the part at the front that people would think about and notice whereas the physical part seems to be more subconscious and therefore not easily identifiable on its own.

Again, sorry for any typos/formatting. I’m on mobile.

SPEAKER3: &gt; As our society moves away from male/female social roles (which is a long ways away until they’re gone, if ever) does this mean that the social roll part doesn’t matter as much?

Frankly the only thing I care about when it comes to gender roles is that people should be free to express themselves however they like and engage in whatever activities/occupations/etc they want, regardless of what gender role they're in.

I think they're more aptly seen in a descriptive way, instead of prescriptive.  As in, sure there will likely be patterns in terms of certain gender roles being over or under represented in certain interests or ways of self expression, etc, and it's okay to notice that.  But that doesn't mean it's okay to prescribe that people in that role *should* express themselves that way.

&gt; Say we reach a point where male/female rolls are unified and no longer exist as separate ideas. Would people still be able to grasp that they’re in the “wrong” body?

Absolutely.  Gender identity is as biological as genital appearance.  If penises and vaginas still exist, then so will gender dysphoria.  And, most trans people say if they were alone on a desert island and would never see another human being again, they still would have needed medical transition.

&gt; The social role part seems to be the part at the front that people would think about and notice whereas the physical part seems to be more subconscious and therefore not easily identifiable on its own.

It is easier to understand not meeting gender role expectations than physical dysphoria, for sure.  This is true of cis people, and actual trans people as they figure themselves out.  The issue with dysphoria is that you don't have the feedback you get from other people to help you understand what's going on, like you do with social role expectations.

It's also true that until they transition, most trans people have known nothing but dysphoria, and don't have a basis for comparison.  This is kind of like being depressed for so long you don't know what it's like to feel any other way.  It makes me think of getting a new pair of glasses, and immediately thinking "holy shit, is this what things are *supposed* to look like??"  A lot of trans people report experiencing something similar as they proceed through medical transition.

Additionally, most cis people have experienced not meeting the expectations for their gender role at some point in their lives, so this is the dimension that is easiest to for them to understand here.  And most cis people think the way they feel in their bodies is a given for everyone, and can't fathom feeling any other way.  It's unfortunately also true that until very recently, trans people were not given the opportunity to speak for themselves, and everything that was available on the subject was from cis people.
